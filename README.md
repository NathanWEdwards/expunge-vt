# expunge-vt
A criminal record can interfere with getting a job, housing, food assistance and other aspects of life. Many records are decades old and are eligible to be removed, but the process can be difficult. Even when a person is aware that they have a record that could be expunged, often financial and logistical barriers stand in the way.

# The Chrome extension

This project works through a chrome extension that reads an HTML docket sheet from https://secure.vermont.gov/vtcdas/user that provides key data a defendant's case. One or more samples of an HTML docket can be found in the "sampleDocketHTML" folder. When the project is complete, the extension will use the data parsed from the HTML to print petitions for expungement ready for filing.

In order to test the extension:

1. Go to chrome://extensions/ on your chrome browser. 

2. Ensure "Developer mode" is switched on in the top right of the screen. 

3. Select "Load unpacked" from the top left, and select the "extensionDirectory" folder from the project folder. 

4. Open an HTML file from "sampleDocketHTML" folder.

5. Click the extension to information for the first "count" listed on the docket.
